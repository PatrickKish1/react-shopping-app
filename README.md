# React Shopping App

Welcome to the React Shopping App project! This project showcases a simple yet functional shopping application built using React. You can view the live demo of the application [here](https://patrickkish1.github.io/react-shopping-app/).

## Overview

The React Shopping App allows users to browse through a list of items, add items to their cart, adjust item quantities, and clear the cart. The project demonstrates key React concepts and best practices, including state management, component composition, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Item Display**: Displays a variety of items with images, names, and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Allows users to add items to their shopping cart.
- **Cart Management**: Users can change item quantities or remove items from the cart.
- **Clear Cart**: Option to clear all items from the cart.

## Lessons Learned

During the development of this project, several important concepts and skills were reinforced and learned:

### State Management with Hooks

- **useState**: Learned to use the `useState` hook for managing component state, such as the items in the cart.
- **State Updates**: Implemented functions to handle adding items to the cart, updating item quantities, and clearing the cart.

### Component-Based Architecture

- **Component Design**: Developed reusable components like `ItemCard` and `Cart`, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Props Handling**: Passed data and functions as props to child components, enabling effective communication between components.

### Responsive Design

- **CSS Flexbox**: Utilized Flexbox for layout management, ensuring the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Applied CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on screen width.

### Styling with CSS

- **Modular CSS**: Used separate CSS files for each component, maintaining a clean and organized codebase.
- **Hover Effects**: Added interactive hover effects to buttons and cards, enhancing the user experience.

### Handling Lists and Keys

- **Rendering Lists**: Learned to map over arrays to dynamically render lists of items.
- **Key Prop**: Applied the `key` prop to list items to optimize rendering performance and avoid warnings in the console.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into the following main files:

- **App.js**: The main component that manages state and renders the `ItemCard` and `Cart` components.
- **ItemCard.js**: A component that displays individual items and provides an option to add them to the cart.
- **Cart.js**: A component that displays the items in the cart, allows quantity changes, and provides a clear cart option.
- **App.css**: Contains global styles for the application.
- **ItemCard.css**: Contains styles specific to the `ItemCard` component.
- **Cart.css**: Contains styles specific to the `Cart` component.

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable learning experience in building a React application with practical features. The skills acquired through this project include state management, component composition, responsive design, and CSS styling. The React Shopping App serves as a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future.
